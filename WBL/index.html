Here you will learn about my internship with The Dayton Society of Natural History. To meet my requirements for my school we had to complete an 80-hour internship over stemersion or over the summer of our Senior year. For my Internship I worked closely with public programs managers and museum educators to learn more about museum education. For this internship I wanted to explore what my future might look like working in a Natural History Museum. Below you will find images and a rundown of what I did each day during my 80-hour internship.        </p>

The first day was orientation at the Boonshoft Museum of Discovery. The day was mainly spent touring the museum and learning how public programs work. I was also introduced to fellow interns and other staff members. I learned about different tools for educating the public and the main activities I would have a hand in running. The image is of the main building. </p>

The second day was my first official day, and I started off at Sunwatch Indian Village. I was assisting a tour group and helping run activities at the archaeological park for most of the morning. We were working with a 4th grade group, and it was interesting to see the questions they were asking and how they interacted with the content. I really enjoyed assisting with a pottery activity we did to help the kids understand archaeology. I finished off the day assisting with preparation for summer camps and shadowing a Do Lab.  This is an image of the Solstice House at Sunwatch. </p>

My third day began assisting with field trip group check-ins at the Boonshoft Museum of Discovery. We had two elementary schools, and it was a good learning experience for how to manage large groups of children and adults.  I spent the rest of the afternoon learning about floor programs at the museum and how they work. I really enjoyed doing the Discovery Table where there are activities for the kids to walk up and it’s a 5–10-minute interaction with the guest. I particularly enjoyed “The Ball Drop Game” an interactive activity where we teach the kids about forces and gravity in a fun, low pressure way.  This is an image of some of the work I was doing outside of the main public programs to help.</p>

I began my 4th day with another group check-in at Sunwatch Indian Village. This was a 5th grade group, and they were an absolute pleasure to interact with. It was raining that day, so we started them off with a tour of the museum and they asked some fantastic questions. I was able to run the pottery activity, which was amazing and gave me some good insight into what being a historical educator would be like. I spent the rest of my day assisting with planetarium shows and learning about how the shows operate at Boonshoft.  This is an image of some bags of cataloged dirt in the basement of Sunwatch. </p>

My next day began with field trip check-ins at the Boonshoft Museum. We had two very large groups arrive and one of the adults was lost and only spoke Spanish, so I had to step in to help her find her way to the field trip group she was supposed to be with. After that, I assisted with the two Do Labs and Science theater where I was actually able to do some of the science experiments while my coworker narrated as I wasn’t quite ready to talk about the science yet. This is an image of some kids doing a do lab.</p>

I assisted in checking-in one large group and a small group of senior citizens to the Boonshoft Museum of Discovery. Then, I helped with a planetarium show for the seniors and got to watch the show with them. The rest of the day was spent assisting with camp prep and floor programs. I ran toddler baskets which is where we sit in the toddler area with toys and have them play in a judgement free relaxed space. This is an image of me working on stuff for summer preparation.</p>

This was the start of the new week, and I was on public programs all day. I ran Toddler Baskets outside and Do Lab in the morning and then in the afternoon a science theater and another Do Lab. The theme for this month was Chemical Reactions so in the do lab we did elephants toothpaste and in the Science Theater we did a variety of experiments, such as a reaction with calcium chloride and baking soda, a glowing reaction with luminol and a whoosh bottle with fire. I mainly just did the experiments while someone else narrated. However, in Do Lab I began explaining certain steps of the process. This is an image of elephant’s toothpaste that I did.</p>

The next day I was on public programs all day so toddler baskets and do lab in the morning, science theater and a second do lab in the afternoon.

This day was the camp counselor’s first day so we did a mock camp day so they could understand what the day would look like at camp. That took up most of the morning and then I helped with the afternoon public programs and ran the entire do lab and half of the science theater by myself. I explained what a chemical reaction was and explained as I did elephant’s toothpaste using potassium iodine and 30% Hydrogen Peroxide. This is an image of the logo for the summer camps.</p>

I was on public programs all day and I was able to fully run Do Lab. It was extremely busy, so we had to do two of them back-to-back and it was hard to reset. Elephant’s toothpaste makes a big foamy mess, so we had to rinse everything, and it was nice because a bunch of the other educators came in to help. I also helped with classroom set-up for camps and helped move things to where they were supposed to be. I spent the afternoon at PAX training learning how to work with kids and different strategies to use when they have undesirable behavior. This is an image of the PAX logo.</p>

This was my last day at Boonshoft, and I ran all the public programs. I did toddler baskets and ran both do labs. I also helped train a new intern on the different floor programs and had them help me explain lab safety to the kids for Do Lab. I was planning on having them run one of the experiments for Science Theater but when we were practicing, they almost caught themselves on fire and I decided it was best for them to sit back for the actual one. I finished off the day with some final cleaning for camps. This is an image of me in my lab coat before science theater. </div>

      <p class="mt-3 overflow-y-hidden text-2xl md:text-3xl leading-8 text-stone-100/85 text-left break-words">
Overall, my internship taught me that I did not want to go into education, but I am still extremely interested in Archaeology and Museum Studies. I am just less interested in the education of younger generations in terms of science. In the future, I hope to investigate what Archaeology and Anthropology looks like in the job force. I think that I will try to get more experience working with artifacts and working in curation of exhibits.   </section>
